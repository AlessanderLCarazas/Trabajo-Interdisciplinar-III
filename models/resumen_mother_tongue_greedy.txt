And her e you would be presented with a list of four poss ible pairs, one of which showed the same kind of relationship: red is to stopl ight, bus is to arrival, chills is to feve r, yawn is to borin g: Well, I could neve r think that wa y. I knew what the tests wer e askin g, but I could not block out of m y mind the i mages already created b y the first pair, "sunset is to nightf all" - and I would see a burst of colors ag ainst a darkenin g sky, the moon rising, the lowe ring of a curtain of stars. And all the other pairs of words - red, bus, s toplight, boring - just threw up a mass of confusing imag es, makin g it impossible for me to s ort out something as logi cal as saying: "A sunset pr ecedes night fall" is the same as " a chill precedes a feve r." The onl y way I would hav e gotten that answ er right would hav e been to i magine an asso ciative situat ion, fo r examp le, my being disobedient and staying out past sunset, cat ching a chill at night, which turns into feve rish pneumonia as punishment, which indeed did happen to me. S o I never did well on tes ts like that The same was true with word analo gies, pairs of words in which you were supposed to find some sort of logical, semantic relationship - for example, "Sunset is to nightf all as is t o."
